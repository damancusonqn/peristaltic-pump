# Peristaltic pump for small liquid flow rates

## Simple peristaltic pump designed for small liquid flow rates.

Designed in FreeCAD v0.20. STL exported parts inside /exports

* Powered by a NEMA 17 stepper motor
* Designed for small silicone hoses (OD = 3 mm, ID = 1 mm). Bigger diameters could be used but you might need to modify the groove profile
* 6x rollers to help minimize the pulsing/hammering effect of traditional 3 roller pumps to give a more constant flow
* Parts optimized for FDM 3D printing
* Rollers are 2 mm diameter steel pins (13 mm long), and PTFE hoses (ID = 2mm, OD = 4 mm)
* All hardare is metric M3 (socket head cap screws, hex flat head and DIN913 set-screws)
